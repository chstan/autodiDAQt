# Getting Started with DAQuiri

This DAQuiri application was created through `python -m daquiri.runner.template`. To get started, from the directory containing this file activate your environment and run `python app.py`. 

If you are using a managed UI around DAQuiri, you do not need to start your application or source your environment: these steps will be handled for you.
