Coming Soon
===========

DAQuiri follows roughly a semantic versioning scheme. We will not to break any interfaces
following 1.0.0, and if there is a need for backwards incompatible changes they will happen
on major (X.-.-) release numbers. Bugfixes and documentation changes will occur on bugfix
(-.-.Z) release numbers. Backwards compatible feature releases will occur on minor (-.Y.-)
release numbers.

Related to Axes
---------------

1. (1.2.0) Axis settling, mostly finished: API depends on user requirements

Related to UI/UI Generation
---------------------------

1. (1.1.0) Display record of scans, repeat scan from log

Related to Experiments
----------------------

Tests
-----

Because all of the examples and profiling code touch most codepaths,
test coverage is already very good. We are also trying to build integration
tests that cover non-UI parts of the codebase.

1. (1.1.0) Coverage exceeding 30%
2. (1.2.0) Coverage exceeding 50%
3. (1.3.0) Coverage exceeding 70%
4. (1.4.0 and later) Coverage exceeding 90%

Scans
-----

1. (1.1.0) Repeat scans from the historical record
2. (1.5.0) Ability to scan files specified in
           external documents <-> stronger interaction with analysis runtimes

App-level/Miscellaneous
-----------------------

Documentation
-------------

1. (1.1.1) More documentation and better documentation cross-linking.

Analysis
--------

1. (1.3.0) Utilities to examine the structure of previous experiments.
2. (1.4.0) Utilities to browse old experiments
