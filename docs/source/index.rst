DAQuiri: Painless scientific DAQ
================================

**DAQuiri** := DAQ + UI generation + reactivity + instruments

You should be spending your time designing and running experiments,
not your DAQ software.

DAQuiri is a nuts and bolts included framework for scientific data acquisition (DAQ), designed
for rapid prototyping and the challenging DAQ environment of angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy. If you specify how to *sequence* motions and data collection, daquiri can manage
the user interface, talking to and managing instruments, plotting interim data, data collation,
and IO for you. Despite all this, DAQuiri is very low overhead and is profiled before
each release: acquisition rates faster than 100Î¼s are possible on synthetic tasks, meaning
most reasonable experiments will be IO bound using DAQuiri.

If DAQuiri doesn't do exactly what you need, get in contact with us or check out the
examples. There's a good chance that if it isn't built in, DAQuiri is flexible enough to support
your use case.
